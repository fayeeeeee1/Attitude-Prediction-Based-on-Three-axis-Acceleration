# Attitude-Prediction-Based-on-Three-axis-Acceleration
A simple demo, using accelerometer data, classifies and recognizes different activities (e.g. walking, running, sitting, standing) by building convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory network (CNN-LSTM) models. The project covers the complete process of data generation, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and more.
